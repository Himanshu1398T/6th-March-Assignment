    "The most commonly used measures of central tendency are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Mean: The mean is calculated by summing all the values in the dataset and dividing by the total number of observations. It represents the average value of the dataset. The mean is sensitive to extreme values and provides a balanced representation when the data is roughly symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Median: The median is the middle value when the dataset is sorted in ascending or descending order. If there is an even number of observations, the median is the average of the two middle values. The median is less sensitive to extreme values and provides a measure of the central value when the data is skewed or contains outliers.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Mode: The mode represents the most frequently occurring value(s) in the dataset. It is useful for categorical or discrete data where there may be distinct peaks or clusters. The mode can provide insight into the most common category or value in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The commonly used measures of variability include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Range: The range is the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the dataset. It provides a basic measure of the spread but is sensitive to extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Variance: Variance measures the average squared deviation of each data point from the mean. It quantifies the spread of data around the mean. A higher variance indicates greater dispersion in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Standard Deviation: The standard deviation is the square root of the variance. It represents the average deviation of data points from the mean. Standard deviation provides a more interpretable measure of dispersion, as it is in the same units as the original data.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "These measures of central tendency and variability provide insights into the distribution, typical values, and spread of a dataset. By using these measures together, we can gain a better understanding of the characteristics and patterns within the data. However, it's important to note that no single measure can fully capture the complexity of a dataset, and it's often necessary to consider multiple measures in combination."
